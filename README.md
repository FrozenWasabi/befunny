#Loque
## What it does
Loque is a Processing-based software for a virtual conversation partner and service. Emulate talking with someone for the first time and learn how to begin and end conversations with ease. Choose from three conversation options to respond and start conversations with someone online. Each message sent is accompanied by a reaction that can be seen through their response. A negative response from the receiver drops their impression of you. Once that impression drops below a certain point they will end the conversation. The user's goal is to maintain a conversation and not have it end prematurely.

## Inspiration
The original plan and idea for an Educational software was something akin to a dating simulator, but that would not have been realistic to create in the given amount of time. Many ideas were thrown around before the final result was a more simplified chatting simulator that could teach you how to converse with others. 

## Educational Purpose
Loque serves an educational purpose by helping teach people how to talk and communicate with strangers for the first time online. They must learn to find social norms and appropriate ways to continue conversations. Through practice and first-hand experience, users will understand different ways to make conversations interesting and engaging. Users will receive positive and negative feedback for each of their chosen messages which allows them to learn and improve with practice. Loque aims to improve the user's communication skills so they can hold typical conversations.

## How we built it
The application was built with Processing IDE through the Python language. The minim library was imported to add music and sound effects. Inputs were taken with the mouse that can click buttons on the screen. The code is predominantly composed of 2D and 3D arrays as well as for loops to facilitate the storyline. 

## Challenges we faced 
Due to the 65-hour time constraint, we had to learn how to make do with the time we had. Throughout the project, we were reminded that not every idea can be implemented within the time frame. We learned to give up on ideas that were too ambitious such as creating a mobile app. We also had to prioritize our time to focus on completing the main framework of the game rather than small negligible details such as fonts. Keeping track of time was vital to save enough for fixing bugs and completing the submission process. In the end, we learned to settle for completion rather than perfection. 

## What did we learn
As processing was a skill that we werenâ€™t fluent in, we had to familiarize ourselves with the unique syntax that is used in the application. GitHub was also a new experience for most of us, with the many features being slightly confusing in the beginning. By the end of the project, we learned how to create a text messaging prototype that uses predetermined content.
